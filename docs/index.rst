ThreadMem Library Reference
============================

The ThreadMem library offers a comprehensive interface for creating and managing persistent chat threads, 
tailored specifically for role-based communication. Each message within a thread is uniquely identified 
and associated with a specific role, ensuring a structured communication environment. 
Furthermore, the library supports the organization of messages based on roles within threads, 
which can be either public or private, and allows for detailed tracking and versioning of thread changes over time.
